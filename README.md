# DNATranslation-tool
This is a python self defined function which will translate DNA code into protien.

This is a very basic level code which is easy to use and later on i'll include a code which can download the data of the nucleic acid wihout going to external srever.


after running the translation tool you can check the translation from the ncbi website. 

hope you'll enjoy this and please do tell if things can simplified or upgraded..
